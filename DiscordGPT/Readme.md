I have created a discord bot and you can access it on my discord at: 
https://discord.gg/2fgKpJWbyC

That is a image of the demonstration of the ai.

***Image generation*** 
It can essentially make any image depending on what you ask it with !image ''

***TTS sound file generator***
if you do !tts '' Then it will make a tts file and send it to discord through a mp3 file and the file will contain any text you said.

***YT video downloader***
It will automatically download and send the video you requested if it is under the 8 mb discord limit. In the future i plan on adding a dropbox link that you can download bigger vids from.

***Faster responce time*** 
It can respond up to 2x faster than the py file.


This one is better overall
