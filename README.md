# PythonGPT
This is a chat gpt locally ran piece of code. This was made with python and should get a few updates every so often. This includes a custom menu.

Installation

Openai - $pip install openai
speech_recognition -  $pip install speechrecognition
time - $pip install time
tkinter - $pip install tk








***Voice from ai***
This uses text from the ai and uses a tts module to convert it to sound

Because this is in early access and is nowhere near finished i may not publish for a little while until i get it working. But it is comepletely open source.

***Voice Recognition****
This piece of software has the built in feature to speak out what you want it to say so you dont have to type out the entire thing.

This currently is in beta so dont expect it to work immediatly.

***Customizeable tones***

When you download the file there will be a text document that has a scentance that you can use to change how you want your ai to sound, have its goal to be something, and really anyother thing regarding personality.

***Modoration***
This is still moderated and still has a filter on what you can ask but there is most certainly workarounds for it and ways to bypass or recode it to do what you want. But for the use of releasing I am releasing this as Moderated.

(Update, this no longer has moderation and no filter)


***Customizeable settings***
It has a customizeable settings menu where you can change the prompt you are using and also you can use the settings menu to change the temperature and you can also change the token it is using and it can also change the max tokens (length) of the responces.



***No filter***
The messages that it replies with but unless it is seriously horrible it will be blocked but other than that that it should work


***BETA***

This is still in beta.

***discord bot***
This is a feature i had just recently implemented and it is same stuff but a discord bot.  I am not going to publicaly release the code for this as i had put lots of effort and it has all of my keys in it but you can invite the bot using the uAuth link here.

It can also generate some pretty basic images and i find that cool and you can use the gpt ai to ask it to change the picture slightly
